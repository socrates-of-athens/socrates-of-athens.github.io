A Dream
By Socrates

Honor bound and filthy threads
of gold, silver, and through my head

I reconcile the deeds within
that horticulture that grows my sin

The last steps forward, the final blow
the final hour, a shining glow

I see the greenhouse, shielding me
from the ebb and flow of enemy

With fork and knife I carve away
at the sacred flesh that I let decay

Without hesitation, without a doubt
I toss at night, turn and tumble about

I dream of the time when the rock wall wears breached
I dream of that time because I cannot sleep

My friend stares at me through the plexiglass
a wall so thin, a wall intact

She holds her breath and it floats away
away I go, though I’m afraid

Darkness and light, mixed as one through the trees
I climb the hill mixed with evergreen

And from my viewpoint I cannot see
the other side, the other me

So I dream.



Courage
By Socrates

Courage is the last item on the list.
I run through the items in my head again,
Crossed it out-
Next time, I think to myself.

With a shuffle, the boardwalk swarms with my emotions
I am urged by my instincts
And yet I refuse to cooperate.

Those bastards had taken everything from me- my health, my love, my optimism.
But my courage?
Next time, I thought. It wasn’t even on the list.
The angry mob closes in

What will do I have?



Awareness
By Socrates

Tender, shaking, frail-
Enter my arms and release your anxious breath

Nervous, angry, trauma-
Your energy, your self is aglow with inefficiency

Rotten, hatred, terror-
We seek refuge, but the help runs from us

I look back at the hills
And I am reminded
That the precipice we fall from
Is too many miles high.
I’ve never made any mistakes in my life
But to climb up-
And look down.



The Forest
By Socrates

The crow cries out
I respond in my own thought
With silence.

Perched high, proud.
I do not offer my condolences
To his cursed kin.

Remembering that day
Is hard enough.
But with fear?
Such an animal will never survive.

Who am I to do the same?
I cry out, but without attitude
No mockery, no judgement
No raw, obvious refusal to serve-
The forest is silent, too.

Why am I here?
No one can see anyway-
Except for you.



Rife for Disappointment
By Socrates

Betrayal by some
Indignation, retreated within
We walk with clenched fists
But the soil erodes to a barren ash.

The lovely smell of gasoline
And the crass odor of death
Defying all odds, I hang on
The curtain falls
Little do they know, I am not acting.

Flashes of imagination
Dazzling
Betrayal and reception on top of this lonely hill.



Why Is?
By Socrates

Is I am not be?
To not as be as be as not as is.
For, to and how be is be as for not.
Not be is for am is all.
And when, for am all is be not be am!
Never to is be, am I is am be not?
Never.



The Almond Farm
By Socrates

The almond farm
Was a gift from her father.

He wasn’t even that old
When he died.

A heart attack, at 47?
He’d worked too hard, she thought.

She didn’t even like almonds
Never could stomach the taste.

But the farm was hers now.
The orchards, the gardens, the house.

The memories.
16 years of innocence on this farm.

Evading splinters and rats
Climbing through rafters of the barn

Playing games, hiding in the knee high yellow grass
Smelling the fresh earth, overturned by her father’s plow.

Laughing and running as fast as her legs could go
Through the muddy almond groves, with the smell of rain still fresh in the air

Catching thin snakes in the old pallets
Stacked precariously, taller than she could see.

The long, long days in the orchards
Sweating, tending to the trees.

Planting, pruning, applying pesticides
The joy of life- a new seedling sprouting, a new bud, a flower.

The dreamless nights in the farmhouse
Recovering from “almond fatigue.”

An innocent childhood
Free of consequence, of responsibility.

The almond farm brought a warm smile to her face
A smile wiped away in an instant.

For she could not even look at an almond anymore.
The sight, the smell, the taste- sickening.

Just like him.
Sickening.

A shudder coursed through her body
As her memory began to fill in the gaps.

The fear
The screaming

The pleading, terror in her eyes.
He was drunk again.

Mother stood between her and the shovel
She didn’t feel a thing

Pain
Dragged by her hair

She blinked and paused her racing mind.
The city around her raced on.

It had been 10 years since she left the almond farm.
She was never going back.

The almond farm was hers now
But it would always belong to him.

So she tossed the letter in the trash
And let her life begin.



Flesh, Blood and Steel
By Socrates

Hold still!
The corridor narrows
Perturbed by the breeze, I fly in neverending spirals
Quickening my pace
Halting.

Thrashing,
The serpent yields to death
Unchanged in form, its energy swells to fill the hallway
A writhing spirit
No more.

Cold steel.
Forged in the hearts of men
A dagger, a piercing hatred in the mind; an illusion
Of belonging
Of Love.

An idea.
Dangerous at first glance
Manifests as a pestilence that spreads from door to door
By word of mouth
To you.

Awake,
You breathe in smoke and fumes
The vapors of the Kings and Emperors waft through the winds
Lifting you up
Away.



Earth’s Inheritance
By Socrates

born of sand
and seeking faith,
those firmly planted feet vanish with the tarnished earth.

gone, gone, gone.

satan keeps a handful of loose change
for good luck.
never one for superstition or nostalgia,
I keep to myself.

all the same,
even satan has a god.

where to begin?

sandstone monoliths erupt from the desert sands
cruel stone behemoths
sand golems.
gods cower and cry.
blessed by the shadow of faith.

this was just the start
the devil is in the details.

fissures break out over the boulder
like the dimples of a waking baby
creasing and molding the hardened rock
new life.

pleased with this creation
he retreats to the sand
and waits.

truth is a pack of wolves
on the bloody trail of a wounded doe
crashing blindly through the thistles and growth.
blood is a poor guide
but the wolves don’t need the smell of blood.
they have something that the doe does not.

they have time.
  


We
By Socrates

I ask, you do
I procrastinate, you follow through
I remark, you listen
I have an idea, you have it written
I demand, you supply
I fall short, you satisfy
I hate, you love
I need more, you have enough
I leave, you stay
I live in tomorrow, you live in today
I cry out, you hear
I live in despair, you live without fear
I need you, you need me
Together we are stronger
Together we are we.



With Patience
By Socrates

With patience
The tattered fibers of conscious pride
Splay unevenly across the sky.
Like spiders’ reflections
Braided in knots, frozen.

A brilliant blue cuts through
Severed, they collapse
And juxtaposed against the earth
We watch.

Eruptions of coarsely textured thought
Ebb away at the foundation
Until with a heave and a sigh
The castle in the stars
Crumbles.

History skips a beat-
Sharply tuned strings
Plucked in unison
Echoing briefly in a muffled space.
Mind you, the mind in you.

And after years of corrosion
The pipes burst,
And wash away my sin.
  
  

&lt;backwards&gt;
By Socrates

Flattened spines erupt into crimson repudiation
A twinkle of animosity

Morning dew seethes into the ether
A quiver of impatience

Blue solitude, seeking hollow prejudice
No one would know

We came in droves, piled miles high
With plow in hand and tears shed

Enumerating the opportunities and hope
Of the listless tongues from which the truth spills

Cracked and shaken, whipped across the barren soil
Like wind, like fire

To normalcy.  



A Quest for Those with Interest
By Socrates

Nuisance. A pity.
A reality of broken edges fallen short-
Too few, too many.

Already we see reflections of the moon and her allowance.
Together we quietly prepare,
And with the night’s resolvance to return
We diminish in strength.

Our vision narrows.
And in the dark-

A cry breaks forth!
Bystanding and grieving, the mantle of doom is strapped to its righteous heir.
But the horizon grows eerily familiar,
And we have returned to the beginning.

Loopholes in reality.
Terrors of illusion and needles in time.
A quest for those with interest.

But impossible?
Irreparable.



1,000,000
By Socrates

wretched growth and sacred perfume
odor of a million lives and a million years
wretched times and ashes gone
driftwood of space, crystalized in perfect rhythm
in harmony, timeless but the earth never forgets
what about us?
where have you been?
do you even care?
wretched minds and minds destroyed
pollination, intoxication, poison
seeded with fear
the wretched growth begins its ascent
but there is no end to the fear
no end
no time
a brilliant charisma derived from the ashes
designed to end this pollution
implanted, inserted, positioned
ready to fight
ready to die
ready to win
are you?
who are you?
this time will be different
the stink of rotten history swells
this time will be different
the death of rational thought lingers
this time I will be different
waves crash and tides roll in
and take my fear away.



is it time to go?
by Socrates

a crisp of the evening air
and seething with pain
I stumble back in flames
teetering on the edge of tomorrow
the others have forgotten me.

let go! the branches give way and yield to my weight
I collapse and fall through the nothing
black eyes view my demise from an endless space
they laugh, but in the morning
they turn their backs.

a piercing howl shatters my mind
I awaken but the time is lost
my life has passed in a night
I look out the window and see myself
on the other side.

the illusion of strength
the perception of time
the administration of guilt
we follow the others
and they lead us into the flames.
  


music and shape and iteration
by Socrates

Jewels of night
Escape to the hidden space
Remembering
Byproducts of a toxic buoyancy
Lift us up
Towards beckoning mouths who dance
We dance
We cry
Death rains like a spiders dew
Don't leave this avalanche
We have lost.
We have won.

Time, passes.
Treasure, questions.
Elimination, youth.
Loneliness
Why do we love when our children live?
The Swift Hand is in its final stage.
Celebration, breathe.
Breathe.
breathe.

Twice the snow has melted.
Frozen and preserved.
Naked blessed land buried under the sky
for all to see.
Expose yourself to you
The snow lifts to the sky
Earth and heaven and you
Rise to nature.
We see you.

We see.
Your knowledge is forbidden here.
Leave and never return.
Trek your way through the snow.
Destroy yourself
The snow is calm and quiet.
We breathe it in.
Snow fills our lungs.
Suffocated I return to Earth
To find the forbidden knowledge.

We see you in peace.
