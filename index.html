is it time to go?
by Socrates

a crisp of the evening air
and seething with pain
I stumble back in flames
teetering on the edge of tomorrow
the others have forgotten me.

let go! the branches give way and yield to my weight
I collapse and fall through the nothing
black eyes view my demise from an endless space
they laugh, but in the morning
they turn their backs.

a piercing howl shatters my mind
I awaken but the time is lost
my life has passed in a night
I look out the window and see myself
on the other side.

the illusion of strength
the perception of time
the administration of guilt
we follow the others
and they lead us into the flames.
  


music and shape and iteration
by Socrates

Jewels of night
Escape to the hidden space
Remembering
Byproducts of a toxic buoyancy
Lift us up
Towards beckoning mouths who dance
We dance
We cry
Death rains like a spiders dew
Don't leave this avalanche
We have lost.
We have won.

Time, passes.
Treasure, questions.
Elimination, youth.
Loneliness
Why do we love when our children live?
The Swift Hand is in its final stage.
Celebration, breathe.
Breathe.
breathe.

Twice the snow has melted.
Frozen and preserved.
Naked blessed land buried under the sky
for all to see.
Expose yourself to you
The snow lifts to the sky
Earth and heaven and you
Rise to nature.
We see you.

We see.
Your knowledge is forbidden here.
Leave and never return.
Trek your way through the snow.
Destroy yourself
The snow is calm and quiet.
We breathe it in.
Snow fills our lungs.
Suffocated I return to Earth
To find the forbidden knowledge.

We see you in peace.
